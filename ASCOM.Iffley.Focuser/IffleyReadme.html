    <title>ASCOM Iffley Focuser driver</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The driver is written in C# and currently targets ASCOM Platform 6.2</p>
    <p>If installation has succeeded, you will see this entry in the Chooser</p>
    <code>Iffley Arduino unipolar stepper motor focuser</code>

    <p>You can then proceed to try it with an ASCOM client (APT,
ASCOM Conformance Checker, FocusMax).</p>

    <p>The Properties Dialog looks like this</p>

    </p>
    <p>The fields are mostly self-explanatory: 
    You will need to figure which COM port corresponds
to the Arduino that runs the focuser (use the Device Manager).</p>
    <p>The Step Size is something you will be able to calculate for your particular mechanical 
    setup, move the focuser10000 steps and get your ruler out!</p>
    <p>Try not to exceed 65000 for Max Step, this is the maximum
        extent of the focuser's travel (the other limit being the 0 point). The Arduino counter
        will overflow after 65535 so that's the reason for this limitation.</p>

    <p>For Max Increment any positive number up to Max Step should be fine.</p>

    <p>You will probably want to tick the Absolute property but
        using it as a Relative focuser is ok too. Absolute mode reports the Position 
    of the focuser so that you can come back to a known point. However, if there 
    is any slippage in the mechanics all bets are off and you may find that returning 
    the focuser to a previously good Position does not reset the optics exactly
     where they were.</p>

    <p>Increase the Timeout if for any reason you fail to make connection with
     the focuser (assuming you have set the correct Comm Port!)</p>

    <p>The ResetToZero button will be active when the driver has established connection.
     Pressing it will do two things: Reset the coils of the stepper motor to the 
    phase at initial Position (this might cause the focuser to physically move a 
    few nominal steps) and set the Position to zero. The stepper is run in half-step
     mode so each nominal step is half a full step. In half-step mode, there's 8 
    different coil phases so the jump to zero should not be more 4 half-steps away.</p>
    <p>My focuser has a physical switch that allows me to cut the power to the coils. I can
    then move the focuser manually near the focus position, hit ResetToZero and turn the power
    back on, without disconnecting the focuser.</p>
    <p>The driver implements a SupportedAction Focuser:ResetToZero so any clients that are so 
    inclined can include a control to do this action.</p>
    <h1>Internals</h1>
    <p>The driver assumes every motor step is successful and results in a fixed linear 
    distance travelled. There's no other feedback of position. This means there must be no
    slippage in the mechanics and it's up to you to adjust the mechanical tension and alignment
    of parts to make sure that is so. A single letter is sent down the serial port to the Arduino
    (the speed is 19200). An "f" provokes a forward step and a "b" a backwards step. "F" and"B" 
    force 10 steps at a time.</p>
